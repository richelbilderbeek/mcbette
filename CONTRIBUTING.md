These are all checked by Travis CI when submitting
a Pull Request. 

Emails with code will not be accepted.

## Submitting bugs

Awesome. These are your options:

 * Add an Issue, with [a reprex](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-do-one/5219)
 * Submit a Pull Request, where the test is added to the `tests/testthat` folder.
   Fork from the `develop` branch
 * Send @richelbilderbeek an email (@richelbilderbeek will make an Issue of it)

Pull Requests should follow the same guidelines as 'Submitting code'.

## Branching policy
